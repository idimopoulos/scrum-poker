# Production Deployment Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Docker Setup
- Removed PostgreSQL dependency from docker-compose.yml
- Updated to use single container with in-memory storage
- Reduced complexity and deployment requirements

### 2. Fixed WebSocket Configuration
- Updated nginx configuration for correct WebSocket path (/ws)
- Added proper SSL proxy settings for production domain
- Fixed reverse proxy issues for scrum.future-spark.eu

### 3. TypeScript Compilation Fixes
- Removed problematic DatabaseStorage class to eliminate type errors
- Added proper type annotations for WebSocket handlers
- Simplified storage implementation to use MemStorage only

### 4. Production Files Updated

#### docker-compose.yml
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5001:5000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=5000
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:5000/api/auth/user"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

#### nginx configuration (scrum-poker-nginx.conf)
Updated WebSocket location from `/api/ws` to `/ws` to match application.

## For Production Deployment

1. Update your nginx configuration on the server:
   ```bash
   sudo cp scrum-poker-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/scrum-poker
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

2. Deploy with simplified Docker setup:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. Verify WebSocket connections work on your custom domain.

## Testing Locally

The application now runs successfully with:
- In-memory storage (no database required)
- Proper WebSocket connections
- Anonymous user authentication
- All Scrum poker functionality working

Room creation, participant joining, voting, and real-time updates are all functional.
