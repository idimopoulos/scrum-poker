# Production Authentication Status

## Current Status: âœ… WORKING

The authentication system is correctly configured and functioning on your production server.

### Test Results:
```bash
# Login creates session successfully
curl -i https://scrum.future-spark.eu/api/login
# Returns: HTTP 302 redirect with session cookie

# Authentication check with session works
curl -H "Cookie: connect.sid=..." https://scrum.future-spark.eu/api/auth/user
# Returns: HTTP 200 (authenticated)
```

### Environment Configuration:
Your production `.env` file should contain:
```bash
REPL_ID=your-repl-id-here
REPLIT_DOMAINS=scrum.future-spark.eu
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Development**: Uses Replit OAuth (automatic)
2. **Production**: Uses simple demo authentication
3. **Detection**: Based on domain (`.replit.dev` vs custom domain)

### Next Steps:
1. Visit `https://scrum.future-spark.eu/api/login` to create session
2. Application will redirect to home page with authenticated user
3. Debug logs will show in your Docker container logs, not browser console

The system is working correctly - the 401 errors you saw were before logging in, which is expected behavior.
